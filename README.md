# Fisierul teste.in contine :
Pe prima linie numarul de vectori nesortati care doresc sa fie sortati, iar pe urmatoarele linii cate un vector cu virgula intre fiecare termen

# The sorting methods used in the project :
1. RadixSort: RadixSort has a time complexity of O(d * (n + k)), where d is the number of digits in the maximum element in the array, n is the number of elements in the array, and k is the range of values in the array. This makes it particularly efficient for sorting large arrays with small values.
2. MergeSort: MergeSort has a time complexity of O(n * log n), where n is the number of elements in the array. While not the most efficient sorting algorithm in terms of time complexity, MergeSort is a stable algorithm that guarantees O(n * log n) time complexity.
3. ShellSort: ShellSort has a time complexity that depends on the gap sequence used. The worst-case time complexity is O(n^2), but typically the gap sequence is chosen to produce better results, resulting in a time complexity of O(n * log n). ShellSort is particularly effective for small to medium-sized arrays.
4. HeapSort: HeapSort has a time complexity of O(n * log n), where n is the number of elements in the array. HeapSort is particularly effective for large arrays, but its main disadvantage is that it is not a stable sorting algorithm.
5. BucketSort: BucketSort has a time complexity of O(n + k), where n is the number of elements in the array and k is the number of buckets used. BucketSort is particularly effective for arrays with uniformly distributed elements, and is often used as a sub-routine in other sorting algorithms.
